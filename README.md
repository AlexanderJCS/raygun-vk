# rt-vk
A Vulkan ray tracer. Currently trying to get the basics working, so please excuse the lack of a readme for now.

TODO encapsulate in the following namespaces:
* rt::core -> `Buffer`, `DescriptorSet`
* rt::graphics -> `Shader`, `Model`, `PushConstants`
* rt::window -> `Window`, input (when added)
